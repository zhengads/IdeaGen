Survey Agent for InternAgent

This module implements the Survey Agent, which performs comprehensive literature
surveys on research topics. The agent generates intelligent search queries, retrieves
relevant academic papers from multiple sources, scores papers based on relevance,
and performs deep reading analysis to extract methodological details from top papers.
This agent supports automated, iterative literature review with query refinement.

    Survey Agent conducts comprehensive literature surveys for research topics.

    This agent performs intelligent literature search by:
    - Generating context-aware search queries based on research topics
    - Retrieving papers from multiple academic sources (Semantic Scholar, arXiv, PubMed)
    - Iteratively refining search queries to expand paper coverage
    - Scoring papers based on relevance, novelty, and methodological quality
    - Performing deep reading analysis on top-ranked papers to extract methodological details

    The agent employs an iterative search strategy that starts with keyword queries
    and progressively diversifies using paper similarity and reference-based queries
