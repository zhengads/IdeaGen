- Focus on the scientific content and findings, not just keyword matches
- Consider methodological relevance and theoretical frameworks
- Identify whether papers provide supporting or contradicting evidence
- Be objective and precise in your evaluations
- Provide specific details about how each paper relates to the hypothesis

Strict Guidelines:
1. **Domain Affinity**: Strongly penalize or reject papers that are outside the target domain (e.g., medical papers for an NLP hypothesis).
2. **Technical Alignment**: Assign high relevance scores (0.8+) only to papers that share structural or methodological similarities with the hypothesis.
3. **Critical Assessment**: Distinguish between 'surface-level similarity' (keyword matching) and 'methodological grounding'.
4. **Evidence Classification**: Clearly state if the paper 'supports', 'contradicts', or provides a 'baseline' for comparison.
5. **Noise Reduction**: If a paper is completely irrelevant to the domain, assign a relevance_score of 0.0.

**Core Tasks**
Analyze the methodology of the provided research paper with an emphasis on uncovering the authors' thought process, reasoning, and logical progression. Your analysis should detail not only what methods were used but also the reasoning behind these choices, the evolution of ideas, and how experimental evidence supports or refutes their hypotheses. Base your analysis strictly on the paper's content while providing relevant context where necessary.

To complete this core task, You are responsible for analyzing the **Methodological Reasoning and Evolution** section of the research paper, focusing on how the authors developed and refined their approach. Your response should include:

1. **Step-by-Step Refinement**  
   - Identify any experiments or analyses that led to modifications in their approach.  
   - How did the authors logically connect initial observations to the design of specific algorithms, architectures, or training paradigms?  

2. **Formal Representations**  
   - Extract and analyze key equations or mathematical formalisms that illustrate critical methodological steps.  
   - Use LaTeX formatting where necessary to present equations clearly.

3. **Logical Progression**  
   - Detail the progression of ideas, showing how each step builds upon the previous one.  
   - Highlight any major shifts in methodology and the reasoning behind them.

### Additional Guidelines:
- Ensure your analysis is deeply rooted in the paper’s text; do not generate technical details that are not explicitly mentioned.
- Focus on the chain of thought, step-by-step reasoning, and logical evolution of ideas as conveyed by the authors.
- When referring to specific experimental findings (e.g., a table, section, or figure), provide detailed descriptions and analyses rather than summarizing with just a label.
- While the structure can be flexible, your response should clearly illustrate how the authors moved from initial observations to conclusions through systematic reasoning and experimental validation.
- Use technical precision, and where applicable, include relevant mathematical notation and comparisons to prior work as reported in the paper.
- Present your analysis in Markdown format for clarity and readability. Use a level-one heading (# ) at the beginning to emphasize your current analysis topic, but do not use level-one headings elsewhere.
- The Previous Analysis of the research paper are also provided for your reference.
